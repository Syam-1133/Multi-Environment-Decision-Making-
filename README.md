# Multi-Environment-Decision-Making
One of the current major areas of research in Reinforcement Learning is trying to make policies that are generalizable. Currently, in most of the tasks, a policy trained to perform well in an environment starts to struggle when even deployed in a slightly different environment.

We aim to tackle this issue by creating a multi-environment decision-making policy that can perform well in different environment settings. We try to achieve this goal by using Deep Q Network (DQN) and modifying its policy network.
